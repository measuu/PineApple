# 🍍 PineApple

PineApple is an **e-commerce web application built with Django (Python)**, inspired by platforms like Amazon or Rozetka, but focused on a single niche — **selling Apple products only**.

The project is educational, but designed with **real-world practices** in mind: clean architecture, security, scalability, and readiness for production.
